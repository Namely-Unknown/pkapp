Add Exception handling to all deletes
Consider returning ResponseEntity<>(null, HttpStatus.OK) for OrderItem POST Mappings to save on data throughput - Not really going to do much as items are returned other than assure we have a HttpStatus.OK
Add checks to all POST mappings to make sure minimum data is present
Plan views to return and do additional mappings as needed -> potentially accept a string second arg on mapToView with the desired view type to return.  This would require an abstract parent view class for each view.
Validate things like containerId or plantId prior to making product?
make get requests into /entity/getdependency/id
Likely want to return name for any PARENTITEM id in view model
